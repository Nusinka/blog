Newbies and experienced streamers alike tend to fall prey to a popular misconception. That is, if you want a cool image quality you must buy an expensive webcam or SLR camera. But the reality is, even such an investment may have no effect. The reason for that is that the image quality doesn’t depend that much on your equipment and its cost, but rather the lighting settings and your ability to set up your equipment are the things that matter. So, even having an entry-level webcam, you can get a stunning picture. There are many plans on the Internet that describe correct arrangement of light. But what are the options if you’re on the rocks and yet you want to improve the broadcast quality right now. Below we will share the options that everyone can find at home or buy it cheap.

It is the lighting on the ceiling that brings those shadows on your face, a tired look, a dull picture and dark circles around the eyes, the kind that pandas have. Now find what starting point you’re currently at and let’s go!
