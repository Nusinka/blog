Sound quality is one of the most important criteria for a proper **stream** or a **YouTube video**. While your audience might forgive you your pixel webcam or even the complete absence of the main character on the screen, they would probably not put up with a barely audible voice or noise. Now you don’t have to make friends with sound engineers or spend dozens of hours looking for a suitable option - we did it for you.

Let's look at the two main categories of microphones: **USB** mics are the most requested ones because they’re easy to set up and use; **XLR** microphones require phantom power, and for that you’d need sound cards or mixers. Mics of the second type produce sound of much higher quality, but they require skills and tuning. We will talk about XLR devices next time, since they are demanding and not every beginner is ready to dive into technical details right away. We want to provide a simple and universal solution. That is why today we will only talk about microphones that connect via USB.

But before that, let's look at one important definition. What is frequency range and why is it important? This feature describes the range of frequencies or tones that the device can play. It is responsible for how well a particular audio component reproduces the audio recorded and whether the resulting recording will be altered.

**Behringer C-1U** is a great buy to start your career on a low budget. Of course, you’ll not get studio sound, but the 40 Hz to 20 kHz frequency range allows you to get sound quality close to the original. It costs about $50. The key disadvantage is low sensitivity; you will have to record sound or speak live almost directly into it.
