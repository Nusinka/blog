**Make your looks distinct**. The room for imagination is huge here, it’ll be cool if you use your innate distinct features. Perhaps you’ve always been uncomfortable with your nose or some mole, but now you won’t be able to hide them from the audience, so try to use such things to your advantage. Moreover, focus on those parts of your look you’ve always been too conscious about. An expressive hairstyle, eye lenses etc. can also be a good trick. Lastly, you can use accessories, such as glasses or a hat with a channel logo, or you can wear polo shirts of a single style.

No matter how you look, you should be easily recognized by some **key phrases**. Think of a bunch of them. On top of your special greeting and farewell, phrases to thank your viewers for donations and subscriptions, try and come up with a signature line in case of death in the game or vice versa when you kill your opponent in a cool way. You must be recognized by ear.
