We’ve got a hot topic for analysis: how often should you go live? There's an ongoing discussion on this topic within the community. Some believe that **daily streaming** is one way to grow one’s audience faster, while others believe it’s better to cut the number of times one goes online, and rather to pay more attention to preparation and the content itself. So what's the best way to arrange your streaming schedule? Let’s consider all the **pros and cons of daily streams** and come to a conclusion together.

**What's wrong with streaming daily** and why can't we recommend this approach to planning your online career to all and everyone?

- Daily streams take up a lot of energy, which may lead to a burnout. Now it may seem to you that there is no problem running streams 6 to 7 days a week, but are you ready to keep the same pace over a long distance? What if you have to stream this often for several months or years. Obviously, you won’t always be in a mood and breaks are obviously necessary for any person. By allowing more days off to begin with, you will shorten the vacation cooldown that you need to get your affairs in order.
- Escape from real life to a virtual one. Even if you are not that most sociable pumpkin and not a huge fan of spending time outside the house, and/or you’re not interested in romantic relationships, still this in no way means that you should minimize that part of your life outside of games and streaming. That’s because offline communication, hobbies and going out, it all gives you a source of inspiration and topics for discussion on your stream. You’ll have those events in your life that you can share with the audience. When your whole life revolves around your stream alone, then a moment will come when there’s nothing to say that your viewers would not already know about you.
- Background streamer status. With daily broadcasts, one becomes the person who is put on the second monitor while some other things are being done. People will eat, play, and sleep, having you in the background. This is no good, because there will be some online, but no activity. Most likely, your streams will be very generic, your viewers won’t be cautious not to miss something interesting. Getting into trending will become more difficult. There is one more downside to this, and in our opinion it’s the biggest one: if over time you want to reduce the regularity of your streams, then most of the viewers who watched you in the background will find some other “radio” they’ll be listening to while going about their daily business.

So what would we recommend to either beginners or already experienced streamers in order to develop their career as efficiently as possible? Do not overload yourself and don’t waste your breath. It makes no sense to be online for 12 hours a day if the number of viewers tends to zero. It’d be better to go live 3 to 4 times a week and don’t you forget to follow these tips:

- Preparation and then more preparation. For top streamers getting ready for a broadcast takes nearly as many hours as the time on the air, and sometimes even more. They plan their content, the design, as well as topics for discussion, jokes and interesting moments that can later be montaged.
- Make a schedule and stick to it. It also must be very easy to find. Keep it updated on Twitch, on your social networks and let your audience know the launch time of your streams while broadcasting. Ideally, the time you start your stream and the days should be consistent.
- Keep your content fresh and diverse. Even if you're streaming one single game - let's take **League of Legends** as an example - there are interesting ways to do it differently. For example, you can announce a challenge on the stream (top kills or assists), play with the audience, arrange mini-tournaments, collaborate with other streamers (play duos), cosplay your favorite characters for special events.
- The days you’re free and with no particular plans, use this time to create content for other social networks so that more people learn about you from other sources. Make reels; create **TikToks** and additional materials for the game if possible (e.g. building houses and creating characters for the community in **The Sims**); prepare graphic resources for the next broadcasts and make useful acquaintances.

Any advice should be applied guided by the conditions of your situations and your personality being taken into account. Whether you need more days off, or less, it's up to you. But more hours free of streaming alone won’t help you grow your audience faster, though quality content, hard work and a little luck will definitely be of help. Following even the best guides, you get no guarantee of success. Therefore, act according to the dictates of your inner instinct, yet always look at streaming realistically and sensibly. Good luck!
