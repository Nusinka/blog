We gradually reveal the nuances of streaming, tips that help you make progress in this direction and info regarding what to do, [from the very first launch](https://organization.gg/blog/what-do-you-need-to-know-before-your-very-first-stream/) to building a powerful [personal brand](https://organization.gg/blog/personal-br/). Now it's time to give some recommendations for attracting your first followers.

Online is very important, so most streamers tend to focus on this indicator, sometimes to the detriment of the rest. For sure, online is more important than the number of followers, who may never visit the channel again, but the latter is also important for this very matter, it makes people return to your channel and it also serves your and some advertisers’ inner peace. We’ve told you how to raise online [HERE](https://organization.gg/blog/how-to-boost-online-of-a-stream/), now let's get us some followers.

Legitimate ways to get new subscribers can be divided into two categories - organic and motivational (works for freeloaders). Forget about cheating and embedding, there are much more drawbacks to such practices than benefits, don't ruin your channel.

**An appeal asking to follow your channel refers to the organic influx group**:

* Regularly enunciate your appeal vocally. Explain how important this is for you and for the development of the channel.
* Set up a command in your chatbot with a request to click on the heart and follow you. Your appeal must sound sincere. Set a timer for automatic publication so that you’re not distracted while playing - the text is published in the chat without you being involved.
* Play together with your followers.
* Set your chat to follow mode. When in this mode, only your followers can write to the chat on your channel. It's a controversial tool. On the one hand, if the viewer wants to write something, he’ll have to subscribe. But on the other hand, there are people who will make a decision to subscribe only after a little dialogue with the streamer. If they cannot access the chat, it’s very likely that they will simply leave. So it's up to you.
